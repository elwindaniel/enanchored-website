  We are committed to fostering spiritual development in the teenager for
  growth, and in the youth, toward maturity deeply rooted in Christ. As
  Hebrews 6:19 says, &quot;We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm
  and secure,&quot; it thus leads the youthful heart toward faith that would
  stand firm through every season in life. It is our desire, through our
  programs and community, to grow an understanding of God&apos;s love, truth,
  and purpose, anchoring lives in the unshakeable foundation of Christ.
